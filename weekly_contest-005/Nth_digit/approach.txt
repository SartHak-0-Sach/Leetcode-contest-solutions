The general plan:
We firstly get the number that the nth digit belongs to
Then we get the corresponding digit in that number
Approach
To get the number
Firstly we need to get how many digits does that number have.

We can convert the problem into "what range is the number in".
We saparate the ranges into [1, 9], [10, 99], [100, 999]...... This is because the numbers in each range have the same digits, it will be easy for us to find the corresponding number later.
And when we get the range, we know the length of every number in that range, and we calculate the new n, refering to the nth digit beginning from the start point of that range. So it's easy for us to convert the "nth digit" information into the "nth number". So we get the number.
Finally, it is easy get the digit we want in that number, cause we alreadly know the nth digit and the length of every number in that range.
