We can solve this question in simple manner by using recursion. In this question we will first push 1 as the first element(always). Then we will check for 1*10 if it comes in the range of [1,n] or not. And similarly we will keep on muiltiplying 10 until we cross n. Then we will start moving forward by doing plus 1 and adding those values to our solution. Once we reach n we will go one step down by dividing by 10 and add those values and so on.
